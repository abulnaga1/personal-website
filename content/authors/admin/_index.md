I am a final-year PhD candidate working under the supervision of [Nathalie de Leon](https://sites.google.com/view/deleonlab/home) in the department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.
My research focuses on the design and fabrication of hybrid III-V on Diamond nanophotonic devices for coupling to neutral silicon vacancy (SiV0) centres. Currently I am investigating the stabilization of bulk implanted SiV0 centres through chemical surface termination, co-doping, and strain engineering. In parallel, I am fabricating 1D GaAs photonic crystal cavities for purcell-enhanced coupling to SiV0, and AlGaAs-on-Diamond ring resonators for frequency conversion of SiV0 emission to the telecom band.

I received my BASc in Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My thesis work was performed under the supervision of 
[John Madden](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/john-madden) and investigated the fabrication of soft-electronics sensors for use in a smart bedsheet. 
During my undergraduate studies I also worked with 
[Jorge Santiago-Aviles](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=80) at the University of Pennsylvania through an NSF REU on synthesizing biocompatible 
piezoelectric nanofibres for use in a novel noninvasive ear surgery procedure.
