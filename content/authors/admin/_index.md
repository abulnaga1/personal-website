I am a research scientist at Lightsynq Technologies, working on the development of universal optical quantum interconnects that bridge the gap to large-scale quantum computers. I received my PhD from the department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, working under the supervision of Prof. [Nathalie de Leon](https://sites.google.com/view/deleonlab/home).
My PhD research focused on the design and fabrication of hybrid III-V on Diamond nanophotonic devices for coupling to neutral silicon vacancy (SiV0) centres in diamond.

I received my BASc in Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My thesis work was performed under the supervision of Prof.
[John Madden](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/john-madden) and investigated the fabrication of soft-electronics sensors for use in a smart bedsheet. 
During my undergraduate studies I also worked with 
[Jorge Santiago-Aviles](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=80) at the University of Pennsylvania through an NSF REU on synthesizing biocompatible 
piezoelectric nanofibres for use in a novel noninvasive ear surgery procedure.
