I am a 2nd year PhD student working under the supervision of Professor Nathalie de Leon in the department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.
My research focuses on the design and fabrication of semiconductor nanophotonic devices for interfacing with quantum defects (colour centres) in diamond.
With this platform I seek to explore key quantum communication network building block experiments such as spin-photon entanglement at telecom communication wavelengths.
