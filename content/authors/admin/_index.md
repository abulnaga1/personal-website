I am a 2nd year PhD student working under the supervision of [Nathalie de Leon](https://sites.google.com/view/deleonlab/home) in the department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.
My research focuses on the design and fabrication of semiconductor nanophotonic devices for interfacing with quantum defects in diamond.
With this platform I seek to explore key quantum communication network building block experiments such as spin-photon entanglement at telecom communication wavelengths.

I received my BASc in Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My thesis work was performed under the supervision of 
[John Madden](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/john-madden) and investigated the fabrication of soft-electronics sensors for use in a smart bedsheet. 
During my undergraduate studies I also worked with 
[Jorge Santiago-Aviles](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=80) at the University of Pennsylvania on synthesizing biocompatible 
piezoelectric nanofibres for use in a novel noninvasive ear surgery procedure.
