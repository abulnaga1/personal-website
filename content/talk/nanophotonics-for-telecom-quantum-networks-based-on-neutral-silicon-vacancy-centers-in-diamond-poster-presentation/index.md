title: Nanophotonics for telecom quantum networks based on neutral silicon
  vacancy centers in diamond (Poster Presentation)
abstract: We recently reported that the [stabilization of the neutral charge
  state of silicon vacancy center](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6397/60.abstract), SiV0, exhibits spin-lattice relaxation times
  approaching 1 minute and coherence times approaching 1 second below 20K.
  Additionally, the SiV0 center has efficient, stable optical transitions with
  ~90% of its emission into the zero-phonon line and nearâ€“transform-limited
  optical linewidths. We aim to integrate this new defect into a nanophotonic
  platform in order to create an efficient spin-photon interface.
